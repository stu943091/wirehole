## What is this?(Lab VPN)
WireHole is a combination of WireGuard, PiHole, and Unbound in a docker-compose project with the intent of enabling users to quickly and easily create and deploy a personally managed full or split-tunnel WireGuard VPN with ad blocking capabilities (via Pihole), and DNS caching with additional privacy options (via Unbound). 

## Notice
**所有操作請在labsetup branch進行 - push/pull之類**

## Server setup
https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-wireguard

## github token
`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`

### Quickstart
To get started all you need to do is clone the repository and spin up the containers.

```bash
git clone https://UDICatNCHU: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@github.com/NCHU-NLP-Lab/wirehole.git
cd wirehole
docker-compose up
```

## Recommended configuration / Split tunnel:

Modify your wireguard client `AllowedIps` to `10.2.0.0/24` to only tunnel the web panel and DNS traffic.

---

## Access PiHole

While connected to WireGuard, navigate to http://10.2.0.100/admin

*The password (unless you set it in `docker-compose.yml`) is blank.*

## Configuring for Dynamic DNS (DDNS)
If you're using a dynamic DNS provider, you can edit `docker-compose.yml` under "wireguard". 
Here is an excerpt from the file. 

You need to uncomment `#- SERVERURL` so it reads `- SERVERURL` without the `#` and then change `my.ddns.net` to your DDNS URL.

```yaml
wireguard:
   # ...
    environment:
      # ...
      - SERVERURL=my.ddns.net #optional - For use with DDNS (Uncomment to use)
      # ...
 # ...
```

## Modifying the upstream DNS provider for Unbound
If you choose to not use Cloudflare any reason you are able to modify the upstream DNS provider in `unbound.conf`.

Search for `forward-zone` and modify the IP addresses for your chosen DNS provider.

>**NOTE:** The anything after `#` is a comment on the line. 
What this means is it is just there to tell you which DNS provider you put there. It is for you to be able to reference later. I recommend updating this if you change your DNS provider from the default values.


```yaml
forward-zone:
        name: "."
        forward-addr: 1.1.1.1@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-addr: 1.0.0.1@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-addr: 2606:4700:4700::1111@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-addr: 2606:4700:4700::1001@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-tls-upstream: yes
```

## FAQ

### How do you add client configurations?
If the environment variable `PEERS` is set to a number, the container will run in server mode and the necessary server and peer/client confs will be generated. The peer/client config qr codes will be output in the docker log. They will also be saved in text and png format under /config/peerX.

Variables `SERVERURL`, `SERVERPORT`, `INTERNAL_SUBNET` and `PEERDNS` are optional variables used for server mode. Any changes to these environment variables will trigger regeneration of server and peer confs. Peer/client confs will be recreated with existing private/public keys. Delete the peer folders for the keys to be recreated along with the confs.

To add more peers/clients later on, you increment the `PEERS` environment variable and recreate the container.

To display the QR codes of active peers again, you can use the following command and list the peer numbers as arguments: `docker-compose exec wireguard /app/show-peer 1 4 5` will show peers #1 #4 and #5 (Keep in mind that the QR codes are also stored as PNGs in the config folder).

The templates used for server and peer confs are saved under /config/templates. Advanced users can modify these templates and force conf generation by deleting /config/wg0.conf and restarting the container.
